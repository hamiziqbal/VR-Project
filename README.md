# VR-Project
For my DC CS Class Project

In order to setup, you must have a Unity project ready. Create a C++ script for every file and paste the code into it. Drag these scripts into the game objects corresponding to the function. 

The core features of my game consist of:
an object interaction and collection system,
sprinting/movement system,
a dark and spooky environment,
an AI monster chasing you around,
jumpscares,
and VR compatibility.
